# Machine Learning Self Teaching Curriculum

## Goal

Obtain a solid foundation of knowledge and skills to be able to work productively in Machine Learning and AI fields, preferably in the research scientist domain. I want a level that would be hireable, whether I choose to pursue a job or continue with hobbyist work instead.

My goal is to have this solid foundation in 26 weeks of dedicated study (while working full time). I have to say that the timeline is a bit arbitrary, but I feel it's better to put a timeline to it now, despite whether it's a reasonable one. I can adjust if needed.

## Where I'm starting from

I have been a software developer for the past 12 years, working in web and mobile applications with a brief stint in blockchain analysis work. The technologies I have worked with include (but not limited to) various scripting languages (ruby, python, javascript) and frameworks (Rails, React, etc.), databases (Postgres, Cassandra, MongoDB), mobile development tools (React Native, Swift/XCode, Java/Kotlin), and everything required to make a web or mobile app run in the wild (cloud tools, hosting, dev tools, testing, analytics, etc, etc, etc.).

I _feel_ like I'm decent at math, but I haven't really had to use it much in the software development work I've done up to this point. The same for complex algorithms - I know the theory and can LEETcode some solutions to problems and tell you the BigO, but wouldn't consider myself an expert.

I work hard, am smart and capable of learning, and most importantly, persist through discomfort.

## List of resources

List of resources I have gathered, in no particular order. I will use these to develop the syllabus below.

- [Curated list of resources](https://llm-utils.org/AI+Learning+Curation), grouped by domain
- [HuggingFace NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)
- [Neural Networks - Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [Understanding Large Language Models](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-large-language-models)
- [a16z's AI Canon](https://a16z.com/2023/05/25/ai-canon/)
- [Youtube: I programmed some creatures. They evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk) - I'm including this because I have a history in biology/evolution, and this video was inspiring. However, It's not a in depth learning resource, but does provide the source code in the description.
- [All the Math you Need to Know in Artifical Intelligence](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/)
- [Understanding Backpropagation Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-algorithm-7bb3aa2f95fd)
- [logit and softmax in deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn4Fme1fK-M)

## Week 0

### Goal: Set myself up for success during this self-driven learning path

### Plan

- Review [All the Math you Need to Know in Artifical Intelligence](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/) in order to identify weak spots in my knowledge, and mark them down.
- Go through the list of resources, and others that I find, to populate the syallabus week by week. This doesn't need to be the end result, and can evolve, but will allow me to get a perspective of the various goals and timelines.

### Results

- TBD
