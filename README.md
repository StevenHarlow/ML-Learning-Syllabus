# Machine Learning Self Teaching Curriculum

## Goal

Obtain a solid foundation of knowledge and skills to be able to work productively in Machine Learning and AI fields, preferably in the research scientist domain. I want a level that would be hireable, whether I choose to pursue a job or continue with hobbyist work instead.

My goal is to have this solid foundation in 26 weeks of dedicated study (while working full time). I have to say that the timeline is a bit arbitrary, but I feel it's better to put a timeline to it now, despite whether it's a reasonable one. I can adjust if needed.

## Where I'm starting from

I have been a software developer for the past 12 years, working in web and mobile applications with a brief stint in blockchain analysis work. The technologies I have worked with include (but not limited to) various scripting languages (ruby, python, javascript) and frameworks (Rails, React, etc.), databases (Postgres, Cassandra, MongoDB), mobile development tools (React Native, Swift/XCode, Java/Kotlin), and everything required to make a web or mobile app run in the wild (cloud tools, hosting, dev tools, testing, analytics, etc, etc, etc.).

I _feel_ like I'm decent at math, but I haven't really had to use it much in the software development work I've done up to this point. The same for complex algorithms - I know the theory and can LEETcode some solutions to problems and tell you the BigO, but wouldn't consider myself an expert.

I work hard, am smart and capable of learning, and most importantly, persist through discomfort.

## List of resources

List of resources I have gathered, in no particular order. I will use these to develop the syllabus below.

- [Curated list of resources](https://llm-utils.org/AI+Learning+Curation), grouped by domain
- [HuggingFace NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)
- [Neural Networks - Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [Understanding Large Language Models](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-large-language-models)
- [a16z's AI Canon](https://a16z.com/2023/05/25/ai-canon/)
- [Youtube: I programmed some creatures. They evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk) - I'm including this because I have a history in biology/evolution, and this video was inspiring. However, It's not a in depth learning resource, but does provide the source code in the description.
- [All the Math you Need to Know in Artifical Intelligence](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/)
- [Understanding Backpropagation Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-algorithm-7bb3aa2f95fd)
- [logit and softmax in deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn4Fme1fK-M)

## Week 0 - Setup

### Goal: Set myself up for success during this self-driven learning path

### Plan

- Review [All the Math you Need to Know in Artifical Intelligence](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/) in order to identify weak spots in my knowledge, and mark them down.
- Go through the list of resources, and others that I find, to populate the syallabus week by week. This doesn't need to be the end result, and can evolve, but will allow me to get a perspective of the various goals and timelines.

### Results

- Math Review Results
  - Practice a bunch of examples of matrix multiplication, obtaining the inverse of 2x2 matrices (for the theory, most of the time I imagine I'll use a matrix calculator), and practice setting up matrix multiplication from word problems.
  - The "All the Math" [resource on Tensors](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tensor.html) was confusing, so find more detailed and gradual instruction on tensors.
  - Practice finding EigenVectors and EigenValues
  - The "All the Math" [resource on SVD](https://web.mit.edu/be.400/www/SVD/Singular_Value_Decomposition.htm) has typos (their transposes are written wrong) and I can't follow the math. Look for another resource.
  - The "All the Math" link on Matrix Calculus is broken, so I went to [another site](https://towardsdatascience.com/matrix-calculus-for-data-scientists-6f0990b9c222). It's honestly not hard, but I don't fully understand the why for some of the examples, which feels like I'm missing small base knowledge, and makes me want to rip through some math courses on Khan Academy to solidify everything here. The ultimate goal is not just to solve these problems, but to understand why the solutions are found using the methods used. Thus, I think week 1 will be primarily some crash courses through some math courses.

## Week 1 - Math Crash Course

### Goal: Solidify my base understanding of the math fundamentals of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics

### Plan

I felt pretty good in the math review last week, but there were some holes that I wanted to fill in and solidify. The objective here is a full understanding of _why_ we perform the math operations we do, and why they work. Primarily I'll be going through these course on Khan Academy:

- [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) - Just going to quickly run through this, in the off case that some of the missing foundational work is here. I think this will be mostly, if not all, review though
- [Differential Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)
- [Integral Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus)
- [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
- [Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
- [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

Honestly, I think I'll be able to go through these in a week. After all this foundational math, I think the following week would benefit from some exploration into practical AI work, so next week I'll go through [a16z's AI Canon](https://a16z.com/2023/05/25/ai-canon/).

### Results

- TBD

## Week 2 - a16z's AI Canon

### Goal: "Get smarter about modern AI"

### Plan

My plan is to go through as much of a16z's [AI Canon](https://a16z.com/2023/05/25/ai-canon/) this week as possible.

### Results

- TBD
